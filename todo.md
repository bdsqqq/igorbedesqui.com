# Major updates
- [x] Migrate Stitches -> tailwind
- [ ] Ditch i18n in favor of english-only. Too much effort for a small demographic and I already do everything english-first anyways.
- [ ] Use MDX as the basis for content. ~~Need to experiment with how it integrates with i18n before committing.~~
    - [x] Got MDX working with my components and i18n, see #26
- [ ] Redesign landing page
    - [ ] hero section, there's too little information above the fold. Something like what [patrick](https://www.patrickaltair.com/) does could work.
    - [ ] With the content direction I'm thinking on taking (more misc writting eg: redstone engineering, failure in interviews, component implementations) the landing page—maybe the whole site actually—will need restructuring. I like what [paco](https://paco.me/)'s "writting" session combined with the featured projects in the landing page. What [James](https://jm.sv/) does with his "work" and "~~work~~" is also interesting. Also, the way [Manuel](https://manuelmoreale.com/) puts navigation links in the copy itself is very interesting (and way more achievable if I actually move to MDX).
- [ ] Project page "about this project" section as an accordion. I like having it fixed so it's accessible at any poing but with the tools there it feels a bit too much.
- [ ] Redesign site "Container", see what [James](https://jm.sv/) does, I like the layered feeling his site has, especially the smol borders horizontally and how it integrates well with a progress bar at the top.
- [ ] resume as .md (Basically free if I actually move to MDX lol)
    - [ ] option to download it as pdf generated by the .md (I mean, the browser print API can go a long way)

# Minor fixes
- [ ] Footer doesn't align with the content in project pages, fix the padding of one of them.
- [ ] StyledLink should be able to break words if they're too long, links tend to have bigass hashes with no spaces or dashes 
- [ ] Update favicon
- [x] Hero section overlay is bein applied to the entire div instead of just over the image
