<Band headline={{ bold: "01", thin: "Why?" }}>
   A few years ago I fell in love with coding by watching <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain">Daniel Shiffman's youtube channel</Link>, following along with <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbcLg8nRWEg&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YxDKpFzf_2D84p0cyk4T7X">his series about Data and APIs</Link> I created the website that got me my first job interview. Thisproject is an update for that website and a lesson on prioritizingand focusing on outcome, it started as me trying to replicate the layout of an asset I saw on ibm.com but it quickly transformedinto a side project that reflects the quality of the work I do. Instead of adding as many animations, features, and info as possible, I choose to focus on functionality, simplicity and aesthetics.

      Request limitations
   </Text>
<Text>
   By using data from a third party, I had a couple of limitations, the most important of them was that I could only make one request per second to the API across all clients, meaning that if enough people visited the website at the same time, I would quickly exceed my API quota. This called for an interesting solution; creating a serverless cache layer to store fresh data and distribute it or refresh it when apropriate is something I never did before but had fun implementing. Using a blazing fast cache like redis on <Link href="https://upstash.com/">Upstash</Link> allowed me to deliver an almost instant experience to users while keeping the amount of requests to an external API in check.


   While server-side challenges are something I don't deal with that much, this one proved to be an interesting learning experience and tought me a pattern that I'm sure I'll use on the future. Also, if you're a nerd, here's a diagram of the cache logic. Simple but effective stuff.

   Incremental enhacement
</Text>
<Text>
   While experimenting with the UI, I came across a problems with browser support, firefox didn't allow me to use some filter features to blur the content behind a div. While I could've just dropped the idea, I took this opportunity to use a pattern called Incremental Enchacement, using the "@supports" query in css, I applied some styles only on browsers that suppored a specific feature. This allowed me to deliver the experience I wanted to users with cutting edge browsers without sacrificing the experience of any user.

      css={{
      display: "grid",
      gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(2, 1fr)",
      gap: "0.5rem",
      marginY: "$spacing-02",
      }}
      className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-1 my-2"

      <Box as="figure" css={{ gridColumnStart: 1 }}>

      While I still plan to do small updates to this project, I consider it done. I love how this tiny piece of user experience— load page, see location—gave me an opportunity to learn, practice and experiment so much.


      If you want to see me losing my mind, changing scope and having
      fun, take a look at the <Link href="https://github.com/bdsqqq/iss-asset/commits/main">commit history</Link>of the project. and If you just want to see it in action, <Link href="https://iss.igorbedesqui.com/">here it is</Link>
