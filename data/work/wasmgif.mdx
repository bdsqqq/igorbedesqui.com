<Band headline={{ bold: "01", thin: "Why?" }}>
   Working at a company with a lot of sensitive data like IBM made me realise the danger of uploading stuff to places you don't trust;
   <br/>
   
   And as a person who makes gifs for my friends regularly, I got concerned! What if some shady conversion website is laughing at my friend's grimace face?
   <br/>

   The natural course of action as a programmer was to make the tool myself, this way I can rest assured that *no data is going anywhere*.

<Band headline={{ bold: "02", thin: "How?" }}>
   The dream was alive, making gifs without sending anything to any server, but how the f#@% would I do it?
   <br/>
   
   After doing my research, I discovered that javascript (the programming language that runs on the browser) is *HORRIBLE* at encoding; But I knew what was great at it: the C programming language, especially with a library called FFMPEG, using it makes transforming any video file into a gif as simple as writing one line in a console.
   <br/>
   
   The next question was: “how can I run C with FFMPEG in the browser?”, and searching it on google was helpful. It turns out I can very easily run C with something called *Web Assembly*. 
   <br/>
   My luck wasn't even close to stopping; At this point I found a [Github repository](https://github.com/fireship-io/react-wasm-gif-maker) that did exactly what I wanted to do; And as a good programmer, I Yoinked it!
   
   After some bug fixing and updates, including remaking the state management and creating a UI from scratch, I was set.
   
   <br/> I finally have a gif-making tool that my friends and I can trust without a doubt.
