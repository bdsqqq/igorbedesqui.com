<ProjectBand headline={{ bold: "01", thin: "Why?" }}>
   A few years ago, I fell in love with coding by watching [Daniel Shiffman's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain). Following [his series about Data and APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbcLg8nRWEg&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YxDKpFzf_2D84p0cyk4T7X) I created the website that got me my first job interview. This project is an update for that website and a lesson on prioritizing. What started as me trying to replicate the complex layout and features of an asset I helped deploy on ibm.com but quickly transformed into a side project that reflects the quality of the work I strive to do. Instead of adding as many animations, features, and info as possible, I focused on delivering the content in a simple and beautiful way.

   <h4 className="text-xl mb-4 font-bold">Request limitations</h4>
   Using data from a third-party API, I had a couple of limitations; especifically, I could only make one request per second across all clients. Without a caching layer of some sort, a few concurrent users, would quickly exceed my quota. This called for an interesting solution;
   <br />
   
   <span className="text-gray-8">
   ~~creating a serverless cache layer to store fresh data and distribute it or refresh it when appropriate is something I never did before but had fun implementing. Using a blazing fast cache like Redis on [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) allowed me to deliver an almost instant experience to users while keeping the number of requests to an external API in check.~~
   </span>
   <br />
   
   <span className="text-gray-8">
   ~~While server-side challenges are something I don't deal with that much, this one proved to be a valuable learning experience and taught me a pattern that I'm sure I'll use in the future.~~
   </span>

<br />
So, about the paragraphs above, what the fuck was I thinking??? I spun up a full-on
Redis service to cache a REQUEST THAT DOESN'T CHANGE BETWEEN USERS.
<br />

The current solution is a SMALLER serverless function that runs faster and is cached on Vercel's EDGE. Supported by a better fetching logic on the frontend, this site should be able to handle any load and update the ISS location as fast as the API allows.

<br />

<h4 className="text-xl my-4 font-bold">Incremental enhacement</h4>
A frosted-glass look was a constant during my experiments, though some browsers didn't support the properties needed for it.
<br />
To keep the experience I wanted for users with cutting-edge browsers without sacrificing the experience for anyone, I leveraged the "@supports" media query to make the blur effect an incremental enhancement.

            The UI in browsers that support filter properties blurs elements behind it.

This feature might be a small detail, but an easy win from an "Oh! that's cool" perspective is always welcome.

   Through the literal years of development, this project saw my preferred solutions and approaches changing; Now, much more than a love letter to someone who shaped my early development, this site became a time capsule of my growth.
   <br />
   This tiny piece of user experience—load page, see location—was an opportunity to learn, practice, and experiment. And I can't wait to see how I'll rebuild it years from now.
