    "01Thin": "Why?",
    "01Copy": "Working at a company with a lot of sensitive data like IBM made me realise the danger of uploading stuff to places you don't trust;<br/><br/>And as a person who makes gifs for my friends regularly, I got concerned! What if some shady conversion website is laughing at my friend's grimace face?<br/><br/>The natural course of action as a programmer was to make the tool myself, this way I can rest assured that <b>no data is going anywhere</b>.",

    "02Thin": "how?",
    "02Copy": "The dream was alive, making gifs without sending anything to any server, but how the f#@% would I do it? <br/><br/>After doing my research, I discovered that javascript (the programming language that runs on the browser) is <b>HORRIBLE</b> at encoding; But I knew what was great at it: the C programming language, especially with a library called FFMPEG, using it makes transforming any video file into a gif as simple as writing one line in a console. <br/><br/>The next question was: “how can I run C with FFMPEG in the browser?”, and searching it on google was helpful. It turns out I can very easily run C with something called <b>Web Assembly</b>. <br/> My luck wasn't even close to stopping; At this point I found a <git>Github repository</git> that did exactly what I wanted to do; And as a good programmer, I Yoinked it! <br/>After some bug fixing and updates, including remaking the state management and creating a UI from scratch, I was set.<br/><br/> I finally have a gif-making tool that my friends and I can trust without a doubt."
