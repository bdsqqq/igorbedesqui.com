                  Dozens of individuals are responsible for my growth, and I'm thankful to have met people who changed how I approach my work. Two that hold a special place in my development are [Rafael Merz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-merz/) and [Sebastian Huynh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-huynh/);

                  1. **Rafael's management style allowed me to pursue quality work and taught me the joy of ownership;** My best work happened under his leadership. **Together we delivered experiences that set a new standard for our organization.**
                  1. **Sebastian's mentorship taught mehow to speak, how to think about design, and from observing him, how to be a better person. I'm lucky to have worked with Sebastian and even luckier to call him a friend.**

                  Leaving was a hard decision, but after two years of aquiring new responsibilities and skills, with no change in pay, I decided to move on. A job at a company this big is transactional relationship after all.

                  <Blur>â€¦And getting paid **7K USD a year as a major contributor to high-impact projects in a multi-billion company** freaked me out. Feeling like a cost savings measure as a third-party offshore contractor in Brazil isn't the best for self worth. **But don't tell anyone, this is a secret!**</Blur>
